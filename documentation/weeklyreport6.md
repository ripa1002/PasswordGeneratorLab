**Weekly Report 6**

This week I implemented Base64 encoding, made some refactoring and added pit test report to test document. Program's core functionality and algorithm implementation is pretty much done, but there's still stuff to do with testing and UI. Before the final deadline I have to implement UI and finalize testing and documentation. Some questions about JAR and runnable test's, also have to solve those.

Weekly hours: 10
