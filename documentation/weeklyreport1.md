**Weekly Report 1**

This week i decided subject, programming language and scope of my lab work. It's been a while since i have used github and netbeans so making repository was a nice recap. I wasn't quite sure how detailed my specification document should be, is it possible to modify the specs later on if scope of the program is too big or too small? Next week i start coding the actual program and algorithms.

This week hours: 5
