**Weekly Report 5**

SHA-1 implementation took most of the time this week. It's quite similar to MD5 but generates longer hash value (160 bits). Little progress elsewhere, however i started playing with performance testing. Next week is reserved for testing, documentation and Base64 implementation.

Weekly hours: 10
