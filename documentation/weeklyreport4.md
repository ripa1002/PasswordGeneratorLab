**Weekly Report 4**

Started implement hash algorithms this week and first in line was MD5. Made some templates for testing and implementation documents, they are still badly in progress. Not yet sure how to do the comparative testing for MD5 and SHA-1. Next thing to do is implement SHA-1 and think about comparative performance testing. Hopefully peer reviews provide some insight.
