**Weekly Report 2**

Started coding the actual program this week. Classes for MD5 and SHA1 algorithms (implemented with MessageDigest for now). Also added test classes for MD5 and SHA1. I struggled a little bit with java package handling while doing tests. Next thing to do is finalize the program so that it does what specification document states. Then I can start the self-made implementations of algorithms.
